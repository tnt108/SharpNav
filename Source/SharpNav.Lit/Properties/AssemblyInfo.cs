// I'm attempting to follow Semantic Versioning with the built-in C# Version class as a fallback
// or alternative to NuGet's semver support. This means I need to do some special things with this
// version number to make sure that comparing these versions match the same order that the semver
// versions do.
// 
// Major and Minor are the same as semver. C#'s "Build" number is semver's "Patch" number. The
// "Revision" number is special. It's based on pre-releases and follow these rules:
// 
// * Alpha versions start at 0 and increment once per released version.
// * Beta versions start at 100 and increment once per released version.
// * The final release of any version will have a revision number of 200.
// 
// This way, a consumer can programmatically determine whether a release of SharpNav is an alpha or
// beta pre-release, or the final released version. comparability between SemVer and C#'s Version
// class is also maintained.

// There are two ways of differentiating versions of SharpNav.dll that are built with engine integrations.
// The first is metadata included with the SemVer version (e.g. 1.0.0-alpha.2+monogame). The second is that
// each version is signed with a separate strong name key, which provides a few extra benefits. Multiple
// integrated versions of SharpNav can now be installed to the GAC without worrying about them interfering
